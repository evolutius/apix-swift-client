# ``APIXClient``

A framework for building API-X based clients.

## Overview

APIXClient provides classes and tools for creating API-X clients. API-X is a type of
server caracterized for its ease of use and high customizability, while maintaining
a high degree of security. Due to its security features, a specific type of
message must accompany each request. APIXClient abstracts all of that functionality
and ensuring the communication is secure so that you can focus on building your apps.
